			"title": "Born in Honolulu",
			"text": "Peter Gene Hernandez is born on October 8 in Honolulu, Hawaii, into a deeply musical family. His father plays Latin percussion and his mother is a talented singer and hula dancer. He grows up performing Elvis Presley impersonations in his family's show act, Little Elvis, at just four years old — catching early local fame and a cameo in the film Honeymoon in Vegas."
		},
		{
			"year": "2004",
			"title": "Moving to Los Angeles",
			"text": "At 17, Bruno moves to Los Angeles with dreams of a record deal. The early years are brutally difficult — he is dropped by Motown Records before releasing a single note. He spends years writing songs for other artists, honing a voice and pen that would soon reshape pop music. He writes for artists like Brandy, Matisyahu, and Adam Levine, living on small co-writing fees."
		},
		{
			"year": "2009",
			"title": "Breakthrough as a Writer",
			"text": "Bruno co-writes Nothin' on You for B.o.B and Billionaire for Travie McCoy, both global hits that crack the Billboard Hot 100's top five. The songs showcase his knack for effortlessly melodic hooks. The world begins to wonder: who is the voice singing those unforgettable choruses? His name starts circulating among industry insiders as a songwriter to watch."
		},
		{
			"year": "2010",
			"title": "Just the Way You Are",
			"text": "His debut single Just the Way You Are is released under Elektra Records and reaches number one in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. The song is disarmingly tender — a direct love letter that strips away pop artifice. It earns him a Grammy for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance and announces him not just as a hitmaker for others, but as a solo force of nature."
		},
		{
			"year": "2012",
			"title": "Unorthodox Jukebox Era",
			"text": "Unorthodox Jukebox confirms he is not a one-trick artist. The album blends funk, reggae, soul, and rock across Locked Out of Heaven, When I Was Your Man, and Gorilla. It debuts at number two on the Billboard 200 and wins the Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album. Critics praise his fearless genre-hopping as a love letter to decades of American music."
		},
		{
			"year": "2014",
			"title": "Super Bowl XLVIII Halftime Show",
			"text": "Bruno performs at the Super Bowl halftime show in New Jersey — the first artist to headline the show solo in years. The performance is electric: spinning, sliding, and commanding a stadium of 80,000 with nothing but his voice and a tight band. Viewing figures exceed 115 million in the United States alone. It cements his status as one of the greatest live performers of his generation."
		},
		{
			"year": "2016",
			"title": "24K Magic",
			"text": "24K Magic is a love letter to 1980s and 1990s R&B and funk — a deliberate, joyful throwback soaked in New Jack Swing, Minneapolis Sound, and Miami bass. The album sweeps the 2018 Grammys, winning all six categories it was nominated in, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year. Bruno becomes only the second artist in Grammy history to win Album of the Year twice as a primary artist."

Leave the Door Open becomes a cultural phenomenon. His Las Vegas residency at Park MGM draws the highest per-show grosses in the city's history. He remains one of the most streamed artists alive, with over 10 billion streams and counting."

			"title": "Born in West Reading",
			"text": "Taylor Alison Swift is born on December 13 in West Reading, Pennsylvania, to a financial advisor father and a homemaker mother who had been a marketing executive. From childhood she immerses herself in musical theatre, studying voice and dance in New York City. At eleven, her family moves to Hendersonville, Tennessee, so she can pursue a country music career — a bold bet that would reshape the entire genre."
		},
		{
			"year": "2004",
			"title": "Signing with Big Machine",
			"text": "At fourteen, Taylor becomes the youngest artist ever signed to Sony/ATV Music Publishing. She then signs with Big Machine Records, a then-fledgling Nashville label. She is handed creative control — an almost unheard-of arrangement for a teenager — and she uses it fiercely, co-writing every song on her debut. The industry is already watching her with a mix of fascination and doubt."
		},
		{
			"year": "2006",
			"title": "Self-Titled Debut",
			"text": "Taylor Swift, her debut album, is released at age sixteen and signals something genuinely new in country music: a teenage girl writing her own diary-entry songs with cinematic clarity. Tim McGraw and Teardrops on My Guitar become radio staples. The album spends over two years on the Billboard 200 and produces four country top-40 singles. She wins the Country Music Association Award for Horizon Award — the beginning of an unbroken awards streak."
		},
		{
			"year": "2008",
			"title": "Fearless and Global Stardom",
			"text": "Fearless shatters genre walls, becoming the best-selling album of 2009 in the United States across all genres. Love Story rewrites country-pop crossover records, and You Belong with Me dominates both charts simultaneously. At twenty, she wins the Grammy for Album of the Year, becoming the youngest artist to do so at that time. The world stops debating whether she was a novelty: Taylor Swift is generational."
		},
		{
			"year": "2012",
			"title": "Red and the Pivot to Pop",
			"text": "Red is the first album where Taylor begins stretching toward pure pop, blending country heartbreak with synth-driven production on We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together and I Knew You Were Trouble. The album sells over one million copies in its first week. Years later, re-recorded as Red (Taylor's Version) in 2021, it charts anew and restores the cultural conversation about who owns an artist's legacy."
		},
		{
			"year": "2014",
			"title": "1989 — Full Pop Arrival",
			"text": "1989 is a declaration: Taylor Swift is a pop star now, full stop. Produced with Max Martin and Shellback, the album opens with Shake It Off and Blank Space — two number-one singles that define the mid-2010s cultural landscape. She pulls her entire catalog from Spotify, a move that sends shockwaves through the streaming industry. The album wins Album of the Year at the Grammys, making her the first woman to win the award twice."
		},
		{
			"year": "2019–2023",
			"title": "The Re-Recording Era",
			"text": "After a public dispute over the ownership of her Big Machine masters, Taylor launches the Taylor's Version project — re-recording her first six albums to reclaim her work. The project is unprecedented: each re-release tops charts and sparks cultural dialogue about artist rights. Midnights (2023) breaks Spotify's single-day streaming record and the Eras Tour becomes the first concert tour to gross over one billion dollars."

She begins performing in community theatre at age eight, appearing in productions of Annie and The Wizard of Oz. Her vocal gift is evident from childhood — a four-octave range that her instructors note is almost preternaturally mature for her age."
		},
		{
			"year": "2009",
			"title": "Broadway and Victorious",
			"text": "At fifteen, Ariana makes her Broadway debut in 13, a musical specifically written for a teenage cast. Her performance earns her a National Youth Theatre Association Award. The following year she lands the role of Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon's Victorious — a bubbly, comedically innocent character that her legions of young fans would adore, even as the singer's voice hinted at something far deeper."
		},
		{
			"year": "2013",
			"title": "Yours Truly — The Debut",
			"text": "Yours Truly debuts at number one on the Billboard 200. The album is soaked in early-1990s R&B nostalgia, and critics immediately compare her voice to Mariah Carey's — an enormous compliment and expectation she would spend years working to outrun. The Problem featuring Iggy Azalea follows in 2014 and becomes a defining pop record, confirming she was not simply a nostalgia act."
		},
		{
			"year": "2014–2016",
			"title": "My Everything & Dangerous Woman",
			"text": "My Everything and Dangerous Woman establish Ariana as a commercial juggernaut. Dangerous Woman in particular is a mature reinvention — softer in palette but more assertive in identity — and her refusal to be pigeon-holed into bubbly pop endears her to fans who had grown alongside her. She headlines the Billboard Music Awards and sells out arenas worldwide."
		},
		{
			"year": "2017",
			"title": "Manchester and One Love",
			"text": "On May 22, a terrorist bombing at her Manchester Arena concert kills 22 people and injures hundreds more. The tragedy shakes the global music community. Within two weeks, Ariana organises One Love Manchester — a benefit concert that raises over 23 million pounds for victims' families. She returns to Manchester, kneels with survivors, and sings. The world watches in tears. It is one of the most courageous acts in modern music history."

			"text": "Sweetener wins the Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album and is universally praised for its emotional maturity. Then, just five months later, Thank U, Next arrives — an album written and recorded in the aftermath of profound personal loss. The title track, released after the death of her ex-partner Mac Miller, is a meditation on gratitude rather than bitterness. It becomes one of the most-streamed songs in history."
		},
		{
			"year": "2019–Now",
			"title": "7 Rings and Cultural Dominance",
			"text": "7 Rings debuts at number one and holds the spot for eight weeks. Ariana becomes the first artist to hold the top three spots on the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously. She headlines Coachella as the youngest solo headliner in the festival's history. Her Positions album and subsequent Eternal Sunshine continue to evolve her artistry. She remains among the most-streamed artists alive, with her influence stretching across pop, R&B, and musical theatre."

She grows up in a conservative Christian household, attending church regularly, and begins singing in the church choir. From early childhood she is drawn to theatrical, expressive music — qualities that would eventually become her defining artistic signature."
		},
		{
			"year": "2017",
			"title": "Signing and the Chappell Roan Name",
			"text": "At seventeen, she is discovered by Dan Nigro, a producer who would become her key collaborator. She signs with Atlantic Records and adopts the stage name Chappell Roan, after an old country song she finds on one of her grandfather's records. The name carries the weight of nostalgia and reinvention — two ideas that would come to define her entire creative project."
		},
		{
			"year": "2020",
			"title": "School Nights EP and Release",
			"text": "Her School Nights EP is released to quiet reception. Atlantic Records drops her shortly after, leaving her without a label for the better part of two years. Rather than retreat, she continues writing and performing, living with her parents in Missouri and returning to local jobs. The period, though grinding, deepens her songwriting and sharpens the maximalist pop-theatrics that would eventually ignite the world."
		},
		{
			"year": "2023",
			"title": "The Rise of the Pink Pony Club",
			"text": "Signed to Island Records and working again with Dan Nigro, Chappell begins releasing singles from her forthcoming debut album. Good Luck, Babe! and Red Wine Supernova build a cult following online — predominantly among LGBTQ+ audiences who find her drag-inspired visual world and unabashedly queer storytelling validating and electrifying. TikTok accelerates her reach beyond any traditional marketing campaign."
		},
		{
			"year": "2024",
			"title": "The Rise and Rise",
			"text": "Her debut album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess is officially released in 2023 to critical ecstasy, but it is throughout 2024 that it becomes a mainstream phenomenon. She performs sold-out shows across North America and Europe, her theatrical live shows — involving elaborate costume changes, lipstick-smeared backup dancers, and stadium-sized camp — earning comparisons to Kate Bush and Lady Gaga in the same breath."
		},
		{
			"year": "2024",
			"title": "Grammy Win and Mainstream Breakthrough",
			"text": "Chappell Roan wins Best New Artist at the 2025 Grammy Awards, delivering a speech in which she openly criticises the music industry's treatment of artists. The moment ricochets across social media and news cycles for days. Good Luck, Babe! is certified multi-platinum in over a dozen countries. She is the rare slow-burn success story: an artist who spent six years in relative obscurity before becoming inescapable."
		},
		{
			"year": "Now",
			"title": "A New Kind of Pop Star",
			"text": "Chappell Roan represents something the mainstream pop landscape had been missing: a maximalist queer theatricality rooted in Midwest sincerity. She is not curated for algorithmic palatability. Her live shows are events — costumed, choreographed, emotionally generous. Her journey from a Missouri church choir to Grammy winner is one of the great origin stories in modern pop music."

His parents separate when he is a toddler and he is raised primarily by his grandmother, speaking Amharic as his first language. He grows up in Scarborough — a diverse, working-class suburb east of Toronto — listening obsessively to Michael Jackson, Prince, and R&B on late-night radio, dreaming of a world far larger than his surroundings."
		},
		{
			"year": "2010",
			"title": "Anonymous Mixtape Trilogy",
			"text": "At nineteen, Abel uploads three songs to YouTube under the anonymous name The Weeknd — a deliberate misspelling to avoid a Canadian band's trademark. The Trilogy mixtapes (House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence) are released for free and spread virally through music blogs. Their sound — smeared, gothic R&B draped in the haze of Drake-era Toronto — is unlike anything else in contemporary music. Nobody knows his face. The mystery amplifies the obsession."
		},
		{
			"year": "2013",
			"title": "Kiss Land and the Industry",
			"text": "Kiss Land, his debut studio album, is released through Republic Records and lands at number two on the Billboard 200. The album is dark, cinematic, and deliberately inaccessible — a refusal of the radio-friendly format that industry executives had been hoping for. Critics call it 'too long, too bleak' while simultaneously calling it a masterpiece. Abel does not compromise. He is building something for the long term."
		},
		{
			"year": "2015",
			"title": "Beauty Behind the Madness",

Earned It wins the Grammy for Best R&B Performance after its placement in Fifty Shades of Grey. The Weeknd performs at the Super Bowl press conference and appears on the cover of Rolling Stone. He is no longer anonymous. He is a global pop star — and he carries his darkness with him anyway."
		},
		{
			"year": "2016",
			"title": "Starboy",
			"text": "Starboy, produced in collaboration with Daft Punk, is a sonic leap — cleaner, more electronic, but still soaked in nocturnal dread. The title track reaches number one in over twenty countries. I Feel It Coming and Secrets demonstrate a more optimistic, disco-inflected side, and the album cements his reputation as an artist who refuses to be contained by genre. He wins the Grammy for Best Urban Contemporary Album."
		},
		{
			"year": "2020",
			"title": "After Hours and Blinding Lights",
			"text": "After Hours produces Blinding Lights — a song that becomes the most-charted song in Billboard Hot 100 history. It spends 57 weeks in the top 10, a record. The accompanying visual world — inspired by 1980s synthwave and neon-soaked noir — is coherent and haunting. His Super Bowl LV halftime performance in 2021 features mirror-masked dancers in a disorienting labyrinth. It is widely considered one of the greatest halftime shows ever staged."
		},
		{
			"year": "2022–Now",
			"title": "Dawn FM and the Final Chapter",
			"text": "Dawn FM is presented as the penultimate album in a trilogy that began with After Hours. Conceptually rich and emotionally sophisticated, it features Jim Carrey as a narrator guiding listeners through a purgatorial radio station. Its follow-up, The Idol (HBO series) expands his creative ambitions to television. He announces that his next album will be his final work as The Weeknd before a new artistic identity emerges. The entire music world waits."
